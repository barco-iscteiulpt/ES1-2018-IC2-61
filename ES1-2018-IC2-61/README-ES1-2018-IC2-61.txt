App: Bom Dia Academia!
Description: Allows user to access and send information from Twitter, Facebook and Gmail. It disposes data in a timeline format, allows search filters creation and it even works offline.

Features:
 - Search multiple sources at the same time
 - View articles in a timeline
 - Comment, reply, like, favorite, retweet and send email from the same place
 - Load last search even when not online

System requirements:
 - Most program features require internet connection. The app is very limited without it

Installation:
 - Only run ES1-2018-IC2-61.jar (the "resources" folder needs to be in the same directory as the app)

Uninstallation:
 - Delete BDA.jar and "resources" folder

Operating Instructions:
 - Facebook only allows commenting in the ES-61 group and only posts using a Facebook page ("O Aroma") due to Facebook limited permissions
 - Twitter shows tweets from one of our personal accounts (Andr√© Carvalho) but anyone can login and interact with their own
 - Email only works with Gmail due to the API used. Can only reply to our own specified email address.

 - Only administrators from the Facebook group and page can do every interaction.
